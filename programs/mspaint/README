This implements mspaint.exe. The code was originally written by Katayama Hirofumi MZ,
see http://markmail.org/message/df3gsjw7bw7tbnxr#query:wine%20mspaint%20wine-patches+page:1+mid:mrrzqefiseorgoos+state:results .
It was cleaned up by Austin English.

Known bugs:
Uses 100% of cpu when running.
Cursor is messed up when drawing.
Some stuff is still unimplemented.

TODO:
Several of the functions are very similar to gdiplus functions and should instead use that.
For advice, ask Vincent Povirk.
