This is the source code for Appinstall, an automated test framework for Wine (http://www.winehq.org),
using AutoHotKey (http://www.autohotkey.com).

If you're just looking to run the test, simply get appinstall.sh from the root directory, save it to your
computer, and run it with 'sh appinstall.sh'. The rest is automatic.

If you're wanting to contribute more tests to Wine, then great! Look in examples/ for example scripts, adjust
it to your program, and send a patch. Be sure to add your test to appinstall.sh!

It's still very much a work in progress, so be sure to check back often for updates.
