This is the binary for AutoHotKey. It doesn't have any dependencies to run, so
rather than download and install it repeatedly, I'm just mirroring the binary and
getting that.

It is available from http://www.autohotkey.com/download/:
http://www.autohotkey.com/download/AutoHotkeyInstall.exe
http://www.autohotkey.com/download/AutoHotkey.zip

The binary here is unmodified from their original.
Mirroring it here, to lessen the burden on their servers.
