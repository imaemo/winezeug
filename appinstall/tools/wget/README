This is the wget tool for windows. Originally from http://users.ugent.be/~bpuype/wget/.
Wget itself is under the GNU GPL license, however this version is bundled with
OpenSSL support. Note an additional license addendum:

"In addition, as a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives permission to link the code of its release of Wget with the OpenSSL project's "OpenSSL" library (or with modified versions of it that use the same license as the "OpenSSL" library), and distribute the linked executables. You must obey the GNU General Public License in all respects for all of the code used other than "OpenSSL". If you modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the file, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version."
