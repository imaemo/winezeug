<h1>Leave Windows Behind - but bring your apps with you</h1>

To be presented at <a href="http://cebit.de/http://www.linux-magazin.de/events/cebit_open_source_forum">CeBIT 2009's Open Source Forum</a>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
Powerful trends today are making non-Windows
operating systems attractive to many people and
organizations, but everybody has a few key
Windows applications they can't do without.
Wine can be a useful tool for running legacy
applications without having to purchase
Windows for every computer.  This talk will
show you how and why you can leave
Windows behind -- and still use key windows
applications.

<h2>Slides</h2>
You can view the draft slides <a href="talk.html">html</a>, <a href="talk.ppt">powerpoint</a>, <a href="talk.odp">ODF Presentation</a>, or <a href="talk.pdf">pdf</a>.  <br>
(I started with .html, and am tweaking the presentation as I convert it into powerpoint/odp, 
so look at the powerpoint to see what it will look like, then switch to the .html if
you want to see what's left to move over.)

<h2>Streaming Video</h2>
