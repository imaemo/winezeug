<h1>Finding memory bugs in Win32 applications with Valgrind</h1>

<h2>Dynamic Analysis</h2>
Writing good software is hard.  
Programmers must always be on the lookout for bugs.  
One of the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering">many techniques</a> 
developed to help programmers do this is called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_program_analysis">dynamic analysis</a>.
In dynamic analysis, programs are run in a special environment
that watches for flaws such as invalid pointers, undefined values, or race conditions.
<p>
The classic dynamic analysis tool is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Purify">Purify</a>.
It's good, but expensive.   The free software world developed a similar tool,
<a href="http://valgrind.org">Valgrind</a>, which is also good, but does not
run on Windows.
<p>
However, Linux can run Windows apps via the <a href="http://winehq.org">Wine</a> compatibility layer,
and Valgrind is compatible with Wine, so Valgrind could potentially replace some of the uses of Purify.

<h2>Chromium, Valgrind, and Win32</h2>
When the Chromium project needed to add dynamic analysis to its continuous
build and test rig, it used Purify on Win32, and Valgrind on Linux and Mac.
To investigate whether Chromium could use Valgrind for Win32, I wrote
two scripts: one to package up the Chromium unit tests built for Windows
so they could be copied to a Linux system, and another to run the
Chromium unit tests under Valgrind.
